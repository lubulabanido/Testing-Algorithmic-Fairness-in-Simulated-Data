Dear reader,

The two files contain the R code and the output of the dissertation. Not all figures are used in the dissertations. And the analysis inside the rmd may be not precise and accurate, only for reference. 

I mean, you can believe in the code and the output, but not all the words.

Thank you if you see this file which shows you are so responsible and so kind to my 3 months work in my dissertation. I am glad you come here.

Also, I want to convey my gratefullness to Jose and Matt who hepl me in this dissertation.

If you are marking my dissertation, I beg you to give as high as possible marks, as I really want a distiction degree to have a chance to go for a futher study in the related area as a future phD.

Best regards,
